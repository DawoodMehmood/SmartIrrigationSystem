# Smart Irrigation System

This Repository is dedicated for my IoT's semester project which is a smart irrigation system used for soil monitoring and conditional watering. 
I made Tinkercad simulation for this project using Arduino UNO, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and many different sensors and actuators for realizing a complete smart irrigation system contributed towards precision agriculture.
